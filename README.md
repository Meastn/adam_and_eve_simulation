Adam and Eve: The Beginning
Open-source HTML5 game simulating human tribes‚Äô survival, reproduction, and migration in a dynamic world. Inspired by Game of Life, built with Grok 3. Beta version 0.5. See below for details.
Version
Version 0.5 (Beta): This is an early beta release of "Adam and Eve: The Beginning." The game is functional but may contain bugs or incomplete features. We actively seek community feedback to refine and improve it before a stable release. Please report issues or suggest enhancements via GitHub Issues.
Overview
"Adam and Eve: The Beginning" is an open-source, browser-based survival simulation game that models the evolution of human tribes (descendants of Adam and Eve) in a procedurally generated, dynamic world. Drawing inspiration from Conway‚Äôs Game of Life, this project explores whether real human behaviors‚Äîsuch as reproduction, migration, resource management, and conflict‚Äîcan be simulated effectively. The game was initially prototyped as a fun side project using ChatGPT 4, but with the power of Grok 3 by xAI, I was able to rewrite and enhance the entire codebase in a single day, adding all features without manually coding myself. My development process involved conceptualizing functions, refining ideas, requesting code generation from Grok, testing, and iterating based on Grok‚Äôs responses.
Purpose and Gameplay
"Adam and Eve: The Beginning" is a survival simulation game where players observe and interact with virtual tribes of humans (Adam and Eve‚Äôs descendants) as they navigate a dynamic world filled with diverse terrains like grasslands, forests, mountains, deserts, oceans, tundra, and coastlines. The goal is to ensure the survival and growth of humanity while managing resources, reproduction, and environmental challenges.
Key Features and Functions
Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of the game‚Äôs mechanics and features:
1. Procedural World Generation
The game generates a random, grid-based world using noise algorithms (Perlin/Simplex noise-inspired) to create realistic landscapes.
Terrains include grasslands (#27ae60), forests (#16a085), water (#3498db), mountains (#7f8c8d), deserts (#f1c40f), coastlines (#e67e22), and tundra (#95a5a6).
Rivers and lakes are procedurally added to enhance environmental diversity.
2. Tribal Dynamics
Players begin with a player-controlled tribe and can observe AI-controlled tribes as they grow, split, or migrate.
Tribes are represented by colored markers on the map, with mood emojis (üòä, üòê, üòü, üò¢) indicating stress levels.
Tribes split when population exceeds a configurable threshold (default 50) and conditions like stress and resource abundance allow.
3. Reproduction and Population Growth
Tribes reproduce based on a configurable reproduction rate (default 0.3), with infant mortality (default 0.05) and maternal mortality (default 0.02).
Reproduction requires at least one fertile female (aged 16‚Äì40) and one male (aged 16+). If only one gender remains (e.g., 1 male, 0 females or vice versa), reproduction stops, and the tribe faces extinction upon the last individual‚Äôs death.
Children (under 12 years) are tracked separately, transitioning to adults at age 12.
4. Resource Management
Tribes consume food and water from their environment, requiring 0.5 units per member per update.
Resources regenerate seasonally: spring boosts food and water, summer reduces water, autumn reduces food, and winter depletes both.
If resources fall below a scarcity threshold (default 0.6), tribes migrate to better locations, impacting health and stress (0‚Äì100 scale).
5. Battles and Tribe Splits
Nearby tribes can engage in battles, with strength based on adult males (aged 16+). The winner captures females, while the loser loses males.
Overcrowding or high stress can trigger tribe splits, creating new tribes at least 10 grid units away from the original.
6. Environmental Seasons
The game cycles through four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter) every three months, affecting resource availability and survival rates.
Each season alters food and water levels, influencing tribe behavior and stress.
7. Player Interaction
Players can click the map to move their tribe to a new location.
Settings panel allows customization of initial population (min 2), male/female counts, max tribe size, reproduction/infant/maternal mortality rates, and scarcity threshold.
8. Multi-Language Support
The game supports Turkish, English, Arabic, and Chinese, with a dropdown menu in the top-right corner for language selection.
All UI text, messages, and tooltips dynamically update based on the chosen language.
9. Game History and Statistics
Tracks tribe histories, including births, deaths, splits, battles, and extinction reasons.
Displays real-time stats (year, month, season, total population, gender counts, children, births, deaths).
Offers options to download tribe logs (TXT), population charts (PNG), and share game results via clipboard.
10. Game Over Conditions
The game ends immediately when all tribes are extinct, triggered by the last member‚Äôs death (e.g., last man or last woman dying) or extreme stress/resource scarcity.
A game-over screen shows tribe history, duration, final tribe count, and reason for extinction, with options to restart or share.
How It Began (Detailed)
The concept emerged from a curiosity about simulating real human behaviors in a simple grid-based system, contrasting with Conway‚Äôs Game of Life‚Äôs abstract cells. Initial experiments with ChatGPT 4 helped prototype basic mechanics, but limitations in complexity and speed prompted a shift to Grok 3. Using Grok 3, I conceptualized the game‚Äôs features (world generation, tribal dynamics, reproduction, etc.), requested code generation, tested outputs, and iterated rapidly. The entire codebase‚ÄîHTML, CSS, and JavaScript‚Äîwas rewritten in a day, showcasing Grok 3‚Äôs capabilities. I never manually coded; instead, I focused on ideation, testing, and refining via Grok‚Äôs responses.
How to Deploy

Development and Contribution
This project was exclusively developed using Grok 3 by xAI, leveraging its AI-driven code generation to prototype and refine the game. I conceptualized features and functions, while Grok 3 handled coding, testing, and iteration based on my feedback. No manual coding was performed; the process relied on ideation, testing, and iterative requests to Grok 3.
